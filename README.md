# Clicky Game

### SpongeBob and Friends


### Overview

In this assignment, I created a memory game with React called `SpongeBob and Friends`. This assignment required me to divide my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Functionality

The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events. The application keeps track of the user's score. When the user initially clicks an image, the user's score is incremented. However, the user's score resets to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page randomly reshuffle themselves. The game restarts when the user's score resets after an incorrect guess.
